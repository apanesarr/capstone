\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to outline the design of individual components that will be used in the HydroSwarm system. This document will also detail specifics about the HydroSwarm structure that is critical to its final implementation. The intended audience for this document is the internal team and other stakeholders who are concerned with the inner workings of the system. This document will serve as a guide during the development process and will help verify and validate design choices. It will also go undergo revision as the development of the system progresses. 
\subsection{Scope}
The scope of this document will cover the software design required to build the HydroSwarm system. It will cover modules such as: Area Coverage Algorithm, Server Communication, Data Storage, Insect Communication, Insect Motor Control, Insect Tracking/Locationing, and Insect Measurement Unit. 
\subsection{Project Overview}
HydroSwarm is a swarm of autonomous robotic boats meant to carry out measurements over large bodies of water. For our project, these boats will be measuring water temperature, but the idea can be expanded to any number of other quantifiable measurements. Central to our work will be two major components. First, a small motorized boat, attached with a water temperature sensor, as well as a control unit that allows it to communicate with and be controlled by a centralized control unit. Second, a software package that can control a large group (\hyperref[sec:definitions]{swarm}) of these boats, with an algorithm focused on producing reliable, accurate, and fast measurements.\\

Our swarm will aim to cover large areas more quickly and cost-effectively than traditional products. To test the applicability of our project, we will demo it on a small scale body of water, such as a swimming pool, as well as develop a simulation to hypothetically prove the efficacy of the system on a larger scale.\\

Our project will be conducted between Fall 2018 â€“- Winter 2019 for our Engineering Capstone project at McMaster University, under the guidance of Dr. Alan Wassyng. We have four Software Engineering students, and one Mechatronics Engineering student. \\ \\

boat hardware, control software, and server running the control software
\item \textbf{Swarm}: A large group of objects (in our case, motorized boats) that can communicate and perform acts as a group
\item \textbf{Insect}: A member of the swarm (in our case, a single motorized boat)
\item \textbf{Simulation}: The simulation will be used for demo purposes, mainly to show that
the system is valid with a large number of insects.

\section{Detailed Class Diagram}
The Detailed Class Diagram is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dcd}, found in the Appendix.

\section{Likely Changes}
Development of Hydroswarm is still in its early stages, and thus there are a number of design decisions that
are likely to change:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Insect positioning system}: The insect positioning system may end up being swapped for a different
    system that works based on G.P.S., Computer Vision tracking, Ultra-wide-band triangulation, or some other approach
    \item \textbf{Number of demo insects}: The number of insects used in the demo are currently set at three (one for
    the initial demo) but this may change based on financial or time constraints
    \item \textbf{Area Coverage Algorithm}: The implementation of the area coverage algorithm is still not entirely
    decided and may be overhauled if a more efficient or effective algorithm is invented
    \item \textbf{Insect Micro-controller}: The insects are currently using an Arduino to handle processing, I/O, and
    communication. This may change in the future, if a more power-efficient or cost-effective chip is found.
    \item \textbf{Boats vs. Cars}: Though our project is currently aimed at using boats to measurement temperature in
    water, if we run into technical difficulties, we may have to switch to cars that make measurements on dry land
    instead.
    \item \textbf{Communication API}: Throughout development the API through which different components communicate
    with one another may be tweaked in order to better facilitate system performance
\end{itemize}

\section{Module Guide}
\subsection{Server Components}
\subsubsection{Area Coverage Algorithm}
\textbf{Responsibilities} \\
The algorithm decides which locations each insect should travel to, in order to

a new location to move to. The algorithm will calculate this value, and pass it on to the
insect so that it can begin travelling there. \\

\subsection{Insect Components}
\subsubsection{Insect Communication}
\textbf{Responsibilities}\\

The data  transmitted will include sensor data, GPS coordinates,and accelerometer output. The data received from the server will include information such as speed and direction based on algorithm output. The hardware components interacting with this subsystem will include a micro-controller and RF transceiver which will have the ability to send and receive data The input will include data that will be sent to the server such as temperature logged, current Location, id, and velocity.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Insect Motor Control}
\textbf{Responsibilities}\\
The motor control subsystem will provide a means for controlling the velocity of each insect.
Each boat in the swarm will have this subsystem which will be responsible for interpreting the
desired speed and direction data received from the communications and Locationing subsystems
and enacting those instructions by sending the appropriate signals to the motors present on each
boat. Each boat has left and right motors which can be controlled separately to achieve speed and direction changes to a boat's velocity. \\

    description: Corresponds to state SHUTDOWN. Cuts power to both motors.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Insect Tracking/Locationing}
\textbf{Responsibilities}\\
The insect tracking and Locationing subsystem is responsible for determining the Location of each
individual insect within the area of coverage, and ensuring that the boat is adhering to the desired
velocity specified by the area coverage algorithm. Therefore each insect/boat will be equipped with
this subsystem. Hardware components of this subsystem include the micro-controller and GPS
module. This subsystem will interact with the communications subsystem and the motor control subsystem. It will send GPS coordinates and velocity to the communications subsystem, and it
will calculate slight adjustments to the boat velocity and send these updates to the motor control
subsystem. \\

\section{Communication Protocols}
\subsection{Algorithm/User Interface}
The server and user interface will both be programmed in C++ and will communicate through C++ API calls.
\subsection{Algorithm/Server Communication API}
The server and user interface will both be programmed in C++ and will communicate through C++ API calls.
\subsection{Server Communication API/Insect Communication API}
The server will communicate with insects through Radio Frequency. Each node will have an RF transciever that can send & receive
data on a particular channel (which will be set manually for each insect).
\subsection{Insect Communication API/Other Insect Modules}
Here, 'Other Insect Modules' refers to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Insect Motor Control
    \item Insect Tracking/Location
    \item Insect Measurement Unit
\end{itemize}

All of these modules will be able to call each others public-facing functions as they will be running on a shared codebase.
\subsection{Algorithm/Data Storage}
The Database will be accessed by the algorithm through the use of ODBC (Open Database Connectivity).

\section{Scheduling}
While it is difficult at this time to determine precisely defined timing constraints, there are several timing and scheduling concerns which are necessary for the most optimal operation of the system. These are outlined in the subsections below.

\subsection{Algorithm/Server Timing Constraints}
To facilitate the smoothest possible operation of the swarm, each insect should know its next destination before it reaches its current destination. This ensures that time is not wasted by the insect in waiting for instructions at each measurement point. The system should satisfy the sequence diagram below.
\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{diagram/next_target_sequence.png}
   \caption{Sequence diagram for determining next location}
\end{figure}
While this scheduling constraint should be relatively easy to meet for a small number of insects, when the swarm begins to grow it may be necessary to prioritize these calculations based on which insect is closest to its current target location.

\subsection{Location Control System}
Due to the presence of drift and other anomalies found in lakes, oceans, etc. that will affect the trajectory of each insect, each insect should be able to correct its path as necessary as it makes its way toward the target location. This means each insect must update its current location at a high enough frequency and in a timely enough manner for the control system to work properly and to prevent the insect from drifting too far from its intended route.
\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{diagram/location_control_sequence.png}
   \caption{Sequence diagram for adjusting insect path}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Hardware Design Notes}
\subsubsection{Motor Control}
The motors on-board the insect are paired with a 3rd party remote controller out of the box, and needs to be changed to allow the server to move the insects. The server will most likely use RF transceivers to send commands to the insects, but a hardware controller is required to interface with the motors. This is where the L239D integrated circuit (IC) comes into play, since it allows any arbitrary microcontoller to be able to interface with the motors bidirectionally. In addition to interfacing with both motors, the time it takes to turn on each individual motor is almost instantaneous. The result of an instantaneous motor control allow the swarm of insects to adapt and change very quickly. The design or wiring schematic of the L239D is given below. 

\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/MotorWiringDiagram.png}
   \caption{Wiring Diagram for Motor Control}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{RF Control}
Communication between the insects and the server must be quick and the range must be limitless to be able to scale the system. The nRF24L01 allows the server to do both, even though the maximum range is described as 20 feet. The range is however limitless when using the associated library since the transceivers can be setup in a mesh network. In addition, RF is also easier to prototype in regards to Arduino and has fairly quick response time through some testing the group has done. The figure below contains the wiring diagram for the nRF24L01 transceiver.  
\begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/nRFWiringDiagram.png}
   \caption{Wiring Diagram for nRF24L01 Transceiver}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Gyroscope and Accelerometer Design}
One of the requirements for the system is for the algorithm to know where the boats are and how fast they are traveling. The Gyroscope allows the insect and server to measure its current orientation. The Accelerometer helps with the second part of the requirement and lets the algorithm know the velocity of the individual insect. The combination of both outputs from the Gyroscope and Accelerometer lets the system know the approximate location and even remaining time for the current survey in progress. However, both sensors must be compact and power efficient to be able to achieve maximum efficiency, thus the MPU6050 sensor was chosen. This integrated circuit is capable of a total of six degrees of freedom and is more power efficient than two individual Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensors respectively. In addition, the polling rate is around 50 samples per second which allows quick response to the server if needed. The schematic wiring diagram for the MPU 6050 is shown in the figure below.
